      <h2>Computing Applications Major</h2>

      <p>
      My goal while completing this course is to strengthen my understanding 
      of advanced computing concepts while learning how to code more effectively 
      and efficiently. I want to gain hands-on experience using all the tools 
      introduced in the course, with a current focus on excelling in GitHub, HTML, 
      and Markdown (.md) files. I have a strong appreciation for the book we are 
      reading because it presents technical concepts through a project management 
      perspective, which helps me better understand how these skills are applied in 
      real-world scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
      For my career goals, I plan to continue working with Farmers and apply the 
      new technical skills I gain from this course to a more degree-specific 
      department within the company. By combining coding knowledge, version control 
      experience, and project management skills, I hope to contribute more effectively 
      to technical projects and increase my overall value as an employee. Ultimately, 
      my goal is to advance into a better position, either within Farmers or elsewhere, 
      by leveraging the skills I develop in this course to support long-term career growth 
      and professional success.
